      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>Coding Outreach is a club designed to simulate real-world environments in the tech industry. At the same time, members are able to 
        serve the community through helping develop websites, writing programs, and fulfilling technical needs for other clubs, 
        non-profit organizations, and so on. Additionally, those who are working on projects will be able to gain programming knowledge and experience along the way.

        If there are any questions or concerns about the website, please email <a href= "mailto:codingoutreach@gmail.com">codingoutreach@gmail.com</a>
